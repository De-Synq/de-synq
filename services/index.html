        <h2>// Frontend</h2>
        <p>
          With over 7 years of experience developing React and React Native
          applications, our expertise covers every facet of development
          including, product planning, navigation architecture, gestures &
          animations, charting, server side rendering, CI/CD and performance. We
          focus on shipping fast and shipping often. While engineering is the
          focus, product is the outcome. We integrate with product and design to
          iterate and discover. The magic of delightful apps lies in the
          successful combination of the two domains.

        <h2>// Backend</h2>
        <p>
          We build backends in Typescript, either via AWS Lambda, Cloudflare
          workers, or NodeJS. Being able to share types between backend and
          frontend is incredibly empowering, allowing for significantly faster
          iteration on new features and bug free refactors. We support backend
          applications with integrated dev ops. Depending on the scale and stage
          of the company, the solutions can vary greatly all the way from
          Next.js functions to Kubernetes. Our focus is on speed, and the
          integration of ops and development is key to unlocking fast and stable
          iterations that provide both platform stability and engineering
          productivity.
